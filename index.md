I am Souradip Chakraborty, currently employed as a *Statistical Research Analyst* at [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/),India working in the field of Statistical Machine Learning and advanced Deep Learning.

Recognised by **Google** as a *Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning* for my community contributions in Machine Learning research and Data Science and being a thought leader in sharing the most innovative ideas by speaking in various prestigious forums

My research interest lies in the area of *Representation Learning,High Dimensional Embedding,Bayesian Inference, Graphical Network and Natural Language Processing*. At Walmart Labs I have filed over **7 U.S Patents** which aimed at extracting and generating Robust and Dense Customer Embedding using customer's intent, consumption pattern, daily household requirements, wastage pattern etc and generating deep customer insights and subsequent recommendation based on that which improved the previous prevalent accuracy by significant margin.Currently working in the field of Graph Convolution Neural Network to efficiently capture the interaction between the stores in retail and model the Store-Store optimisation strategy efficiently in a Semi-supervised framework.

Prior to joining Walmart Labs, I have completed my *M.S in Applied Statistics and Machine Learning* from [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isibang.ac.in/) in 2018 as the Batch Topper (**summa cum laude**) with specialisation in Machine Learning and Statistical Theory. In my *Master's Thesis**, I have worked in the field of *Interpretability of Deep Neural models* and exploring the non-convex space using **Bayesian optimisation**. My dissertation was in the field of developing a new methodology for simultaneous monitoring multiple output characteristics which got published as a *Technical Report in Indian Statistical Institute*. I have also spent 2 years as a research engineer in the R&D department of Amec Foster Wheeler Pvt.Ltd. (headquarters at Houston) in the field of Statistical Quality Control in Oil & Gas field following my bachelor's in Electronics engineering from Jadavpur University (Top 10 institutes in India).
