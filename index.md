I am Souradip Chakraborty, currently a 1st year [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) *PhD student* at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) from *Fall 2021*. My current research focusses on the Theoritical and Practical aspects of *Deep Reinforcement Learning* especially from a Representation learning viewpoint with a special emphasis on learning **State Abstraction**. My research also explores *Sample-efficient* and *Safe Model-based reinforcement learning* under Uncertainty, noisy-settings and Sparse rewards scenarios. I am also extremely interested in designing *Sample-efficient High Dimensional Gaussian Processes* and believe that can pave the pathway for **Self-Supervised Representation Learning**

In the past I have worked as a *Research AI Scientist* at [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/), India after completing my Masters from the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isibang.ac.in/) in 2018 **summa cum laude** and Bachelors in Electronics & Electrical Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India in 2014. Recognised by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) as a *[Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-souradip_chakraborty)* for my open-source contributions & mentorships in the field of AI and ML. 

Co-authored several [US patents and top-tier publications](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=pvETm1wAAAAJ&hl=en) *(COLING, ICPR, ICDM, SIGIR)* in the field of AI & ML applications in NLP and Computer Vision domain. Selected as the Youngest Technical Speaker for the very prestigious Data Hack Summit’2019 and 2018 by Analytics Vidhya. Currently,I am also a Thesis Supervisor for students at upGrad’s online Master’s Program in Data Science as well as Machine Learning with Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU)
